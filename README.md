A Pretty Programming Language

----
As of January 2025, I thought I would be able to create a small programming language. However, I realize that even if I managed to put things together in a makeshift way, it would lack true meaning. I understand that I lack the necessary formal education and the required knowledge of algorithms to accomplish this properly. Since the name holds significant value, Iâ€™ve decided not to proceed with my current attempts. Instead, I will continue my work in 2026 (or earlier, if possible). I wish myself luck.
